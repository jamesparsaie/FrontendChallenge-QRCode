### What I learned

I took on the challenge of this project as a result of my newfound enjoyment for frontend and fullstack development. It served especially as a great learning oppertunity to see a desired finish product, in the sense of a **client's desired end product**, and following through and attempting to recreate the design as best as I can

Additionally, this project served as a great case for me to strengthen my CSS skills specficially within the department of layouts and flexbox's to acheive the desired effect and positioning of the final product
